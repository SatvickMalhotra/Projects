small project that demonstrates the basics of SQL and Excel. The project involves downloading a dataset of Honda car sales and transforming, cleaning, and filtering it. The data is then analyzed and visualized using Excel pivot tables and conditional formatting, while SQL is used to answer some important questions.

The project provides answers to the following questions using SQL:
1. In 2023, how many customers gave a 4+ star rating?
2. In 2022, how many customers gave 3 or less ratings?
3. What are the top 3 most expensive bike models?
4. Which is the most popular car in each state in 2023?
5. Which model has the maximum number of consumer ratings?
6. Which model has the minimum number of consumer ratings in 2022?

This project showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization using Excel and the basics of SQL. The project involves data cleaning, filtering, and analysis, as well as using and conditional formatting, and SQL queries to answer important questions about the dataset. Overall, this project serves as a great example of how SQL and Excel can be used together to analyze and provide useful insights
